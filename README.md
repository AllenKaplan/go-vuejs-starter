# go-vuejs-starter
Get started with Golang and Vue.js using Gorilla/Mux and Vuex

# How does it work
We'll be running two seperate servers, one to host the frontend (supported  by vue.js) and one to host the backend (golang)

##Golang
Gorilla/Mux in main calls the routers to setup

##Vue.js
Store has .js for managing to todos
